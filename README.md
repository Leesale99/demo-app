# React.js Demo App

The main purpose of this project is to represent my understanding of web technologies:
 - [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react),
 - [Redux](http://redux.js.org),
 - [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io)

## Quick Overview

Example of interactive real-estate single page application(SPA). Updates global Redux store through custom filtering and re-renders React components(Map and item-list) accordingly.

Configuration of building process is made from scratch, without using pre-made boilerplates. It uses dependencies like:
  - Babel (Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator),
  - PostCSS (Autoprefixed CSS, that doesn't require -webkit or other prefixes),
  - ESLint, SASS Lint (A dev server that lints for common errors),
  - Hot Module Replacement (Live refresh without reloading the webpage).
