# React.js Demo App

The main goal of this simple application is to represent my understanding of web technologies:
 - React.js,
 - Redux,
 - Webpack

## Quick Overview

Configuration of building process is made from scratch, without using pre-made boilerplates. It uses dependencies like:
  - Babel (Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator),
  - PostCSS (Autoprefixed CSS, that doesn't require -webkit or other prefixes),
  - ESLint, SASS Lint (A dev server that lints for common errors)

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Leesale99/demo-app.git
